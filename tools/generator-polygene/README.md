# Apache Polygene™ Project Generator


## What is Apache Polygene™

The short answer is that **Apache Polygene™** is a community based effort exploring Composite Oriented Programming for
domain centric application development. This includes evolved concepts from
[Aspect Oriented Programming](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aspect-oriented_programming),
[Dependency Injection](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dependency_injection)
and [Domain Driven Design](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domain-driven_design).

Please see [polygene.apache.org](https://polygene.apache.org) for more information.
