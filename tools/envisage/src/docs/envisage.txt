= Envisage =

Envisage is a Swing based visualization tool for the Zestâ„¢ Application model.
Visualizations can be printed to PDFs.

== Usage ==

Envisage can be easily used directly and prior your Application activation:

[snippet,java]
----
source=tools/envisage/src/test/java/org/apache/zest/envisage/school/EnvisageSchoolSample.java
tag=envisage
----

As you can see, Envisage operates on the ApplicationModel, this means that you
can easily embedd it in your own Applications too.

Two gradle tasks runSample and runSchool are defined in this module as a
shortcut to run the examples. See <<build-system>>.
