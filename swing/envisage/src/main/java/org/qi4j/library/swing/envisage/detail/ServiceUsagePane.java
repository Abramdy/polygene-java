 * Service Usage tab, which shows all the 'users' of the Service,
 * meaning the 'reverse' of a Dependency, all 'links' pointing into the Service should be listed here.
 * The list should be in three 'sections' according to the Visibility,
 * i.e. one section for all usages from within the same Module,
 * one section for usages within the same Layer
 * and one section for usages from Layers above.
 * I think the order of these sections
 * should be "LayersAbove", "WithinLayer" and "WithinModule"
 * in that order from top.
