/**
 *  This represents a Query in an indexing system. It is created from a

 * Additional limitations, such as paging, ordering, and variables, can be set on
 * a Query before it is executed by calling one of find(), iterator(),
 * or count().
 * <p/>
 * DDD tip: typically Queries are created in the Domain Model and passed to the UI,
 * which sets the order and paging before executing it.
