/**
 * This annotation is used in composites to declare mixin implementation classes.
 * <p/>
 * ImplementedBy tells the runtime which implementation class of a Mixin that should be
 * used. The ImplementedBY annotation can occur at any level in the composite hierarchy
 * and the runtime will match each found Mixin against a ImplementedBy annotation.
 * All mixin interfaces must have an ImplementedBy in the composite hierarchy or
 * an runtime exception will occur.
 * <p/>
 * Example;
 * <pre><code>
 * @ImplementedBy( MyBeerOrder.class )
 * public interface BeerOrderComposite extends BeerOrder, Composite
 * {
 * }
 *
 * public class MyBeerOrder
 *     implements BeerOrder
 * {
 *     :
 * }
 * </code></pre>
 *
 * Many implementations can be listed,
 * <pre><code>
 * @ImplementedBy( { MyBeerOrder.class, DescriptionImpl.class } )
 * public interface BeerOrderComposite extends BeerOrder, Description, Composite
 * {
 * }
 * </code></pre>
 *
 * If the ImplementedBy is a class that implements InvocationHandler, it will be
 * used for all mixins. To avoid that a invocation handler based implementations
 * are not servicing all mixin, use the AppliesTo annotation.
 *
 * <p/>
 * It is valid to have multiple ImplementedBy for a mixin. The first one found
 * will be used. The search order is in the order they are written in the ImplementedBy
 * annotation left-to-right, and depth-first recursive search of the super-interfaces again
 * left-to-right.
 *
 * @see org.qi4j.api.annotation.AppliesTo
