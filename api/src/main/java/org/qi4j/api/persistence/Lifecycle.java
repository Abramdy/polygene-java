 *
 * This Lifecycle interface is a built-in feature of the Qi4J runtime, which will establish

 * it to client code.
 *
 * Example;
 * <code><pre>
 * public interface System
 * {
 *     User getAdmin();
 *
 *     void setAdmin( User admin );
 *
 * }
 *
 * public class SystemImpl
 *     implements System
 * {
 *     private User admin;
 *
 *     public SystemImpl( User admin )
 *     {
 *         this.admin = admin;
 *     }
 *
 *     public User getAdmin()
 *     {
 *         return admin;
 *     }
 * }
 *
 * public class SystemAdminLifecycleModifier
 *     implements Lifecyle
 * {
 *      @Modifies private Lifecycle next;
 *      @Dependency private CompositeBuilder<System> builder;
 *      @Dependency private EntityRepository repository;
 *      @Uses private Identity meAsIdentity;
 *      @Uses private System meAsSystem;
 *
 *      public void create()
 *      {
 *          String thisId = meAsIdentity.getIdentity();
 *          User admin = repository.newInstance( thisId + ":1", UserComposite.class );
 *          builder.adapt( new SystemImpl( admin ) );
 *          next.create();
 *      }
 *
 *      public void delete()
 *      {
 *          next.delete();
 *          repository.deleteInstance( meAsSystem.getAdmin() );
