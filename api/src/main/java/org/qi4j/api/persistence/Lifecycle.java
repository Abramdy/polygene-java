 * Lifecycle interface for all Composites.

 * any Invocation stack against Lifecycle.class, but the Composite interface should never expose
 * it to client code.
 * <p/>
 * Example;
 * <code><pre>
 * public interface System
 * {
 *     User getAdmin();
 * <p/>
 *     void setAdmin( User admin );
 * <p/>
 * }
 * <p/>
 * public class SystemImpl

 * {
 *     private User admin;
 * <p/>
 *     public User getAdmin()
 *     {
 *         return admin;
 *     }
 * <p/>
 *     public void setAdmin( User admin )
 *     {
 *         this.admin = admin;
 *     }
 * }
 * <p/>
 * public class SystemAdminLifecycleModifier
 *     implements Lifecyle
 * {
 *      @Modifies private Lifecycle next;
 *      @DependsOn private EntitySession session;
 *      @ThisAs private Identity meAsIdentity;
 *      @ThisAs private System meAsSystem;
 * <p/>
 *      public void create()
 *      {
 *          String thisId = meAsIdentity.getIdentity();
 *          CompositeBuilder builder = session.newEntityBuilder( thisId + ":1", UserComposite.class );
 *          User admin = builder.newInstance();
 *          meAsSystem.setAdmin( admin );
 *          next.create();
 *      }
 * <p/>
 *      public void delete()
