/**
 * All operations on entities goes through an UnitOfWork. A UnitOfWork allows you to access
 * Entities and work with them. All modifications to Entities are recorded by the UnitOfWork,
 * and at the end they may be sent to the underlying EntityStore by calling complete(). If the
 * UoW was read-only you may instead simply discard() it.
 *
 * A UoW differs from a traditional Transaction in the sense that it is not tied at all to the underlying
 * storage resource. Because of this there is no timeout on a UoW. It can be very short or very long.
 * Another difference is that if a call to complete() fails, and the cause is validation errors in the
 * Entities of the UoW, then these can be corrected and the UoW retried. By contrast, when a Transaction
 * commit fails, then the whole transaction has to be done from the beginning again.
 *
 * UoW's can be nested easily. The changes done in the nested UoW do not show up in the parent UoW until
 * complete() is called, at which point the changes are merged with the parent UoW. If a nested UoW is
 * discarded then all of the changes made in the nested UoW will be thrown away.
 *
 * A UoW can be associated with a Usecase. A Usecase describes the metainformation about the process
 * to be performed by the UoW. It contains settings such as CAP-guarantees and what state is going to be used
 * by the Usecase, which helps eager loading.
