 * Lifecycle interface for all Composites.

 * This Lifecycle interface is a built-in feature of the Qi4j runtime, which will establish
 * any Invocation stack against Lifecycle.class, but the Composite interface should never expose
 * it to client code.
 * <p/>
 * Example;
 * <code><pre>
 * public interface System
 * {
 *     User getAdmin();
 *
 *     void setAdmin( User admin );
 *
 * }
 *
 * public class SystemImpl

 *
 *     public User getAdmin()
 *     {
 *         return admin;
 *     }
 *
 *     public void setAdmin( User admin )
 *     {
 *         this.admin = admin;
 *     }
 * }
 *
 * public class SystemAdminLifecycleConcern extends ConcernOf<LifeCycle>
 *     implements Lifecyle
 * {
 *      &#64;Structure private UnitOfWork unit;
 *      &#64;This private Identity meAsIdentity;
 *      &#64;This private System meAsSystem;
 *
 *      public void create()

 *          String thisId = meAsIdentity.identity().get();
 *          CompositeBuilder builder = unit.newEntityBuilder( thisId + ":1", UserComposite.class );
 *          User admin = builder.newInstance();
 *          meAsSystem.setAdmin( admin );
 *          next.create();
