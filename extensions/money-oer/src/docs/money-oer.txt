The OpenExchangeRates.org Money Conversion Extension implements the +MoneyConversion+ service by consuming the 
OpenExchangeRates.org JSON API.

See <<core-api-money>> for usage instructions.

If a Qi4j Cache Extension is visible from the Money Conversion service it is leveraged to minimize requests going to
OpenExchangeRates.org. End Of Date rates are cached forever, current rates are cached one hour according to the
OpenExchangeRates.org update policy.
