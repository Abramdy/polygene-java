/**
 * EntityStore backed by Preferences API.
 * <p>
 * A root node is created in the System preferences, whose name
 * is the same as the Application name (default:"Application").
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * Each entity is stored under its identity name.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * Property types are converted to native Preferences API types
 * as much as possible. All others will be serialized to a string using JSON.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * Associations are stored as the identity of the referenced Entity, ManyAssociations are stored as multi-line strings
 * (one identity per line), and NamedAssociations are stored as multi-line strings (one name on a line, identity on the
 * next line).
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * The main use of the EntityStore is for storage of ConfigurationComposites for ServiceComposites.
 * </p>
 * @see org.apache.zest.api.service.ServiceComposite
