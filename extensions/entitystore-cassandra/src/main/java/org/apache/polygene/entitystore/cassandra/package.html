<h2>Casssandra EntityStore.</h2>
    <p>
        The Cassandra EntityStore leverages the CQL 'map' type, which is the "newer" way of doing variable-wdith rows.
    </p>
<p>
    For properties, there is a map called '_props' with string key (the name of the property) and string value,
    which is the serialized state of the property.
</p>
<p>
    For associations, there is map called '_assocs' with string key (the name of the association) and string value,
    which is the entity reference in toString() format.
</p>
<p>
    For manyassociations, there is map called '_manyassocs' with string key (the name of the manyassociation) and
    list of strings value, which is the list of entity references in toString() format.
</p>
<p>
    For namedassociations, there is map called '_manyassocs' with string key (the name of the association) and
    map of strings value, which is the name as the key and the value is the entity reference in toString() format.
