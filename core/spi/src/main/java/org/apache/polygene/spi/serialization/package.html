<h2>Serialization SPI.</h2>
<p>
    This package contains specialized serialization APIs for the {@literal JSON} and {@literal XML} formats.
    See {@link @JsonSerialization}, based on {@literal javax.json},
    and {@link XmlSerialization}, based on {@literal javax.xml}.
</p>
<p>
    This package also contains base implementations, mixins and helpers for serialization API implementations:
</p>
<p><strong>Base implementations</strong></p>
<ul>
    <li>
        Use {@link AbstractTextSerializer} and {@link AbstractTextDeserializer} as a basis to implement the
        serialization API for text representations.
    </li>
    <li>
        Use {@link AbstractBinarySerializer} and {@link AbstractBinaryDeserializer} as a basis to implement the
        serialization API for binary representations.
    </li>
    <li>
        Use {@link AbstractSerializer} and {@link AbstractDeserializer} if you need to handle text/binary conversion
        yourself.
    </li>
</ul>
<p>
    <strong>Mixins</strong>
</p>
<ul>
    <li>{@link BuiltInConverters} provides built-in {@link Converter}s for types supported by the Polygene Runtime.</li>
</ul>
