[[Assembly]]
= Qi4j Core Bootstrap =
Qi4j has a distinct bootstrap phase, also known as the _Assembly_ of an application, where the applications structure
is defined programmatically. Once all the layers, modules and all the composite types in each module have been defined
the model is instantiated into an application. This enables the entire _structure_ system in Qi4j, where types "belongs"
to a module and visibility rules define default behaviors, enforcement of architectural integrity and much more.

The _assembly_ is preceeded by the creation of the _Qi4j Runtime_. The _assembly_ can be declared fully by defining
all modules and layers, and how the layers are sitting on top of each other, OR one can utilize one of the two
convenience assemblies, one for a _pancake_ pattern, where all layers are top on each other, or one with a single module
in a single layer, useful for small applications, spikes and tests.

During _assembly_, the application (JVM level) architecture and the application model is defined. You define which
layers exist and how they relate to each other. For each layer, you define which modules it contains. And for each
module, you define which composites are in it, and what are the visibility rules for each of these composites.

You can also;

    * Define default values for properties.
    * Add additional interfaces to composites dynamically.
    * Add concerns, mixins, constraints and side effects dynamically.
    * Set _meta information_ on composite types.
    * Import external services to be available as Qi4j services.
    * Tag services with markers

== Using Assemblers ==
Many libraries and extensions provides a cookie-cutter _Assembler_, to simplify the set up of such component. Often
these are suitable, but sometimes they won't fit the application in hand, in which case the source code at least
provides information of what is needed for the component to be used.

Assemblers are typically just instantiated and then call the assemble() method with the ModuleAssembly instance,
such as;

== Defining an Entity Store ==
Defining an _Entity Store_ is in principle as simple as defining a ServiceComposite implementing the EntityStore
interface. The problem is that most Entity Stores require <<service-configuration>>, and configuration requires an
Entity Store. This chicken-and-egg problem is resolved by having an entity store available that does not require any
<<service-configuration>>. Many _Assemblers_ for entity store implementations uses the MemoryEntityStore, and
effectively leaves the configuration in the properties file where <<service-configuration>> bootstraps from. It is
possible to chain this, so that for instance the Neo4J Entity Store uses the Preferences Entity Store for its
configuration, and the Preferences Entity Store uses the Memory Entity Store (i.e. the properties file).

The point is that the entity store used for the configuration of the primary entity store used in the application is
that it must not be visible to the application itself. Sometimes it is easiest to put a Memory Entity Store in the
same module, with Visibility set to _module_. Sometimes it makes sense to have an additional Configuration layer below
the infrastructure layer, which has this setup.

As mentioned above, most entity stores defines a reasonable default _Assembler_, possibly with some constructor
arguments to define certain aspects. An example is the popular JdbmEntityStore, which _Assembler_ can be used like;
