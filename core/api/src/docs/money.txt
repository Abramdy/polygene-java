[[core-api-money, Money API]]
= Money API =
The Qi4j platform supports Money idioms thanks to the JodaMoney project and defines a Money Conversion API.

== Money State ==

JodaMoney types, +Money+ and +BigMoney+, are both supported in Values and Entities.

Here are some sample Properties that contains monetary values:

[snippet,java]
--------------
source=core/api/src/test/java/org/qi4j/api/money/DocumentationSupport.java
tag=state
--------------

See <<core-api-value>> and <<core-api-entity>> for details about the serialization of such values.


== Money Conversion ==

The Money API defines the +MoneyConversion+ service API as follows:

[snippet,java]
--------------
source=core/api/src/main/java/org/qi4j/api/money/MoneyConversion.java
tag=conversion
--------------

TIP: By default, no +MoneyConversion+ service is available, you need to choose one among the <<libraries>> and
assemble it in your Application.

The +MoneyConversion+ service supports getting current and past (End Of Day) rates.
+Rate+ objects are dated and allow to perform currency conversion on both +Money+ and +BigMoney+ values.
When converting +Money+ values you can choose the rounding mode to use.

MoneyConversion service is injected like this:

[snippet,java]
--------------
source=core/api/src/test/java/org/qi4j/api/money/DocumentationSupport.java
tag=injection
--------------


You can then use it directly:

[snippet,java]
--------------
source=core/api/src/test/java/org/qi4j/api/money/DocumentationSupport.java
tag=conversion
--------------
