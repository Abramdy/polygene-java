[[concern,Concern]]
= Concern =
Concerns are the equivalent of "around advice" in Aspect Oriented Programming. They are chained into an invocation
stack for each Mixin Type method and invoked after the Constraints have been executed. Since they are sitting "around"
the Mixin implementation method, they also have a chance to modify the returned result, and even skip calling the
underlying Mixin method implementation altogether.

To create a concern, you need to create a class that,

    * implements the Mixin Type (Typed Concerns) or java.lang.reflect.InvocationHandler (Generic Concerns),
    * extend ConcernOf (Typed Concerns) or GenericConcern (Generic Concerns) [1]
