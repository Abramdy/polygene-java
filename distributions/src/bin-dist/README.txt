Welcome to the world of Apache Polygene
   - Composite Oriented Programming on the Java platform.


This Apache Polygene™ Binary Distribution contains everything you need to
create Polygene™ applications.


Polygene™ (then Polygene™) started in 2007, and is still in heavy development
at the Apache Software Foundation. We would like
developers around the world to participate in the advancement of this
cool, new and challenging technology. We are especially interested in
people willing to help improve the SDK, samples, tutorials, documentation
and other supporting material.

Please see https://polygene.apache.org for more information.


Licensing
---------
All Apache Polygene™ code is licensed under an Apache License.

Third-Party Dependencies may be licensed under other terms. The only
required dependencies are SLF4J (MIT Licence), ASM (BSD Licence) and
Joda-Time (Apache Licence).

Finally, Polygene™ TestSupport depends on JUnit 4.x and its dependencies, which
is also not included in the SDK itself, as it is present among most Java
developers.


Dependencies not included
-------------------------
The binary distributions contains Polygene™ artifacts only to keep the download
size small. Each Polygene™ artifact comes with a file prefixed ..-runtime-deps.txt
that contains the list of its dependencies. Moreover, at the binary
distribution's root, you'll find both Maven (go-offline.pom) and Gradle
(go-offline.gradle) build files whoses sole purpose is to easily download all
needed dependencies jars. Instructions are given into theses files.
