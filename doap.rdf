    <shortdesc>Apache Zest is an open source platform for composite oriented programming.</shortdesc>
    <description>Apache Zest is an open source platform for composite oriented programming. Zest is home for Qi4j,
    the composite oriented programming platform for Java, and Qi4Net a port to the .NET CLR.
    Composite oriented programming allows developers to work with 'fragments', smaller than classes, and 'compose'
    fragments into larger 'composites' which acts like the regular objects. Zest also tackles the enforcement
    of application composition, i.e. composites are declared in modules, modules are contained in layers and access
    between layers are controlled/enforced.
