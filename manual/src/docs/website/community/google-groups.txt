=============

To discuss with the Qi4j community, it is easiest to do so at the Google Groups qi4j-dev forum. This forum is open
to everyone and regular open source forum etiquette applies. Failure to be respectful may cause the poster to be
expelled. The forum is a light and friendly one, where we are all friends working on a marvelous way of writing Java
code.
