Qi4j community uses CloudBees Jenkins service to automate the Qi4j SDK build.

The dedicated Jenkins instance can be found at https://qi4j.ci.cloudbees.com/.

Tests jobs allow developers to detect and fix integration problems, broken/incompatible code, conflicting changes
continuously.

Upload jobs deploy SNAPSHOT artifacts for easy dependency on development builds:
https://repository-qi4j.forge.cloudbees.com/snapshot/

Distributions jobs make it easy to get the latest deliverables.
