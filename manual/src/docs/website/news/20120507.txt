= Qi4j Community launches new website =

After years with SiteVision from Senselogic, the Qi4j community has decided that SiteVision does not fulfill the needs
of this community. Primarily, SiteVision can not satisfy some really central needs of open source communities;

* Learning curve for SiteVision is higher than plain text tool chains.

* Offline editing is not possible.

* Distance between Sitevision server and users introduce network latencies that makes the SiteVision experience less
than optimal.

* Versioning is non-trivial. Keeping old versions of the site up and running in parallel will be important as users
seek information about older versions of the Qi4j SDK online.
