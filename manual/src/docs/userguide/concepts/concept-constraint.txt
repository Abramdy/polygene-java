[[def-constraint,Constraint]]
= Constraint =

Constraints are a kind of validators, which are consulted prior to invoking the
method call. Qi4j currently only supports ParameterConstraints on methods and
value constraints on Properties, but future versions will include Constraint
types for checking complete method calls and return values.

See <<core-api-constraint>> for better understanding of its details.

See <<library-constraints>> for ready to use Constraints.

See <<howto-create-constraint>> to learn how to write your own Constraints.

Constraint is one of the 3 kinds of <<def-modifier>>s defined in Qi4j.
