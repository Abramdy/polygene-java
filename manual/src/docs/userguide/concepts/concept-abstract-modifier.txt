[[def-abstract-modifier,Abstract Modifier]]
= Abstract Modifier =
Abstract Modifiers are modifiers (Constraints, Concerns or SideEffects) that do not implement all the methods of
the MixinType interface.

This works essentially in the same manner as the Abstract Mixin. And the methods that are not implemented will not
be part of the invocation stack of those methods.
