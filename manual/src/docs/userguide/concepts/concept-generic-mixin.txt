= Generic Mixin =

A Generic Mixin implements the java.lang.reflect.InvocationHandler. The
invoke() method will be called for all MixinType methods that the Mixin has
been matched with, through the matching rules.

It is potentially possible that the Generic Mixin also implements the MixinType
interface. In that case, the concrete methods will be called, but if the Mixin
is also an abstract class, then the invoke() method will be called for the
methods that has been match but are not present.
