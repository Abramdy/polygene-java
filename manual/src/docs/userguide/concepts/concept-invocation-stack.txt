[[def-invocation-stack,Invocation Stack]]
= Invocation Stack =

For each method, Qi4J will create and re-use an Invocation Stack. It will be
built with the sequence of Modifiers and an end-point that will link into the
stateful Mixin.

It is important to recognize that, for memory footprint reasons, Invocation
Stacks are shared across Composites of the same Composite Type. They are
however thread-safe, in that Qi4j will never bind the same Invocation Stack to
more than one Composite instance during a method call, but that between method
invocations the Modifiers in the Invocation Stack can not assume that it is
bound to the same Composite instance. Therefor, Modifiers are not expected to
keep state between method invocations, and when it needs to do that, then it
should reference a Mixin via the @This annotation. Qi4j will during the binding
of the Invocation Stack to the Composite, also ensure that all referenced
Mixins are correctly injected in the Invocation Stack.
