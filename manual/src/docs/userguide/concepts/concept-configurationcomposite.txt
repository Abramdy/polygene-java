[[def-configurationcomposite,Configuration Composite]]
= Configuration Composite =

Service Composites can have configuration associated to it and that is done via
Configuration Composites, which are a subtype of Entity Composite, as they are
stored permanently in configured Entity Stores. Configuration Composites are
also initialized automatically from properties files first time. Note that on
consequent start-ups the properties file is not read, as the configuration is
read from the entity store.

ConfigurationComposite is one of the 5
<<def-composite-metatype,Composite Meta Types>> defined in Qi4j.

See <<howto-configure-service>> to learn how to use Configuration Composites.
