[[def-modifier,Modifier]]
= Modifier =

Modifiers are stateless interceptors of method calls, that forms an
<<def-invocation-stack>>. The top of the Invocation Stack is linked to the
Composite invocation handler and the bottom of the Invocation Stack is linked
to the Mixins. Invocation Stacks are shared, so Modifiers must assume that the
member fields will only be valid within a single method invocation.

There are 3 kinds of Modifiers;

- <<def-constraint>>s
- <<def-concern>>s
- <<def-sideeffect>>s
