= Composite Context =
A Composite Context is a mechanism to separate the state of a <<def-transientcomposite>> across two or more threads.
If a thread modifies a value, only that thread will see the changes, another thread will have its values protected
by the thread boundaries. Use-cases for this include user credentials on which behalf the thread is executing.
