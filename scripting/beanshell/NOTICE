Dual Licensing: Sun Public License / Gnu Lesser Public License
BeanShell is dual licensed under both the SPL and LGPL.
You may use and develop BeanShell under either license.

Please see the Sun Public License for details.

About the LGPL
Note: the LGPL has become the "Lesser Gnu Public License" and
BeanShell has adopted the new version...

A quick note about the LGPL:

The LGPL is less restrictive than the ordinary GNU Public License in
that it does not force you to distribute your own applications under
the terms of the GPL. It primarily requires that you include a notice
that you are using the software in your documentation and provide
access to the original source code. It also essentially requires that
if you modify or extend BeanShell itself that you make those changes
available separately, under the terms of either the LGPL or the GPL.
I would ask that you accomodate this by simply sending me your bug
fixes and improvement to allow me to incorporate them into the
general BeanShell release. Please see the LGPL for the details.

If you have a more precise, brief explanation please let me know!
Thanks! - Pat
