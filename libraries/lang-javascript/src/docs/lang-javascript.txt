The Javascript Scripting Library allows Mixin methods to be implemented in Javascript and loaded dynamically on first use.

include::../../build/docs/buildinfo/artifact.txt[]

The Javascript Scripting Library is a Generic mixin class that implements 
Composite interfaces by delegating to JavaScript functions using Rhino. Each 
method in an interface is declared as a JS function in a file located in 
classpath with the name "<interface>.<method>.js", where the interface name 
includes the package, and has "." replaced with "/".

Example: 

    org/qi4j/samples/hello/domain/HelloWorldSpeaker.say.js

That means that the HelloWorldSpeaker.say.js file may be co-located with the 
class files in the same package. It is currently not supported to place the 
Javascript implementation of the mixin in a different package than the 
interface it implements.

To use Javascript to implement the Mixin functionality for a given interface, 
simply declare the +JavaScriptMixin+ like any other mixin, either in the 
interface or at assembly time.
