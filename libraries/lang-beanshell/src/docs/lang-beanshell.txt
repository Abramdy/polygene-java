Beanshell Scripting Library

The Beanshell Scripting Library is a Generic mixin that implements interfaces
by delegating to Beanshell method.  Each method in an interface is declared by a
BeanShell method in a file located in classpath with the name _INTEFRACE_FQDN_.bsh,
where the INTEFRACE_FQDN includes the package, and has "." replaced with "/".

    Example:
    org/qi4j/samples/hello/domain/HelloWorldSpeaker.bsh

That means that the HelloWorldSpeaker.bsh file may be co-located with the
class files in the same package. It is currently not supported to place
the BeanShell implementation of the mixin in a different package than the
interface it implements.

To use BeanShell to implement the Mixin functionality for a given interface,
simply declare the +BeanShellMixin+ like any other mixin, either in the interface
or at assembly time.
