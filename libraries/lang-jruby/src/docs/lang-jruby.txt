The JRuby Scripting Library allows Mixin methods to be implemented in Ruby and loaded dynamically on first use.

include::../../build/docs/buildinfo/artifact.txt[]

The JRuby Scripting Library is a Generic mixin that implements interfaces by delegating to Ruby functions using JRuby. Each method in an interface is declared by a Ruby method in a file located in classpath with the name "<interface>.rb", where the interface name includes the package, and has "." replaced with "/".

Example: 

    org/qi4j/samples/hello/domain/HelloWorldSpeaker.rb

That means that the HelloWorldSpeaker.rb file may be co-located with the class files in the same package. It is currently not supported to place the JRuby implementation of the mixin in a different package than the interface it implements.

To use JRuby to implement the Mixin functionality for a given interface, 
simply declare the +JRubyMixin+ like any other mixin, either in the interface 
or at assembly time.
