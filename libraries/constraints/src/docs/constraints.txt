= Constraints =

The Constraints library provide a bunch of often used Constraints based on the
Qi4j Constraints api described in <<def-constraint>>.

Remember that you are not limited to constraints presents in this library, you
are encouraged to write your own constraints. See <<howto-create-constraint>>
or take a look at this library source code to learn how to write your own.

Here are the provided constraints:

- @Contains( ... )
- @Email
- @GreaterThan( ... )
- @InstanceOf( ... )
- @LessThan( ... )
- @Matches( ... )
- @MaxLength( ... )
- @MinLength( ... )
- @NotEmpty
- @OneOf( ... )
- @Range( ... )

You can use theses constraints on Properties or on method arguments.
Here are some examples:
