The Constraints library provide a bunch of often used Constraints based on the Qi4j Constraints api.

Remeber that you are not limited to constraints presents in this library, you are encouraged to write
your own constraints. Looking at this library source code can help you doing so.

Here are the provided constraints:

- @Contains( ... )
- @Email
- @GreaterThan( ... )
- @InstanceOf( ... )
- @LessThan( ... )
- @Matches( ... )
- @MaxLength( ... )
- @MinLength( ... )
- @NotEmpty
- @OneOf( ... )
- @Range( ... )

You can use theses constraints on Properties or on method arguments.
Here are some examples:
