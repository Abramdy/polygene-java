Many applications need authentication of users and authorization of what those users can do. One commong model is a
_role based_ authorization, so that;

. _User_ is assigned a _Role_.
. _Permissions_ are assigned to each _Role_.
. Each _Operation_ require one or more _Permissions_.
. If the _User_ has a _Role_ that contains the required _Permissions_ the _Operation_ is allowed.

Since Java methods are equivalents of _Operations_, and Qi4j is very method centric (See <<def-invocation-stack>>), it
is very natural for Qi4j to support this Authorization model.
