Groovy Scripting Library

include::../../build/docs/buildinfo/artifact.txt[]

The Groovy Scripting Library is a Generic mixin that implements interfaces 
by delegating to Groovy functions using Groovy. Each method in an interface 
is declared by a Groovy method in a file located in classpath with the name
"<interface>.groovy", where the interface name includes the package, and has 
"." replaced with "/".

Example

    org/qi4j/samples/hello/domain/HelloWorldSpeaker.groovy
    org/qi4j/samples/hello/domain/HelloWorldSpeaker.sayAgain.groovy

That means that the HelloWorldSpeaker.groovy file may be co-located with the 
class files in the same package. It is currently not supported to place 
the Groovy implementation of the mixin in a different package than the 
interface it implements.

To use Groovy to implement the Mixin functionality for a given interface, 
simply declare the +GroovyMixin+ like any other mixin, either in the interface 
or at assembly time.
