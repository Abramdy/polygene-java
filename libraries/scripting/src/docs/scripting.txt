--------------
source=libraries/scripting/dev-status.xml
--------------

The Scripting Library allows Mixin methods to be implemented in any JSR-223 scripting language, loaded dynamically on
first use and allowing reloading of the script in runtime.

include::../../build/docs/buildinfo/artifact.txt[]

The Scripting Library is a Generic mixin class that implements
Composite interfaces by delegating to script functions using Java Scripting API. All Java Scripting API (JSR-223)
implementations that support

[code,java]
----
    ((javax.script.Invocable) scriptEngine).invokeFunction( functionName, arguments );
----

should be supported. On Java.Net there is a https://java.net/projects/scripting/sources/svn/show/trunk/engines[list of Java Scripting API languages].


It is important to understand that the ScriptEngines must be present on the classpath, or they will not be available,
with the exception of JavaScript which uses the built-in Nashorn engine and Groovy that is an explicit dependency of
this library.

We welcome additional information and samples of languages that has been tried and tested.

.Not Compatible Languages
[options="header"]
|=======
| Language | Comment
| Java | Implementation exists at https://github.com/nickman/javax-scripting/ which is forked from https://java.net/projects/scripting. It doesn't support Invocable, and additional work on ScriptMixin is required to support this. Althernatively, fork the ScriptEngine implementation and support Invocable in it.
