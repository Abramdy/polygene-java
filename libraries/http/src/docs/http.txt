= HTTP =

The HTTP library provide a Jetty based embedded HTTP service with support for easy servlets and filters assembly.

== Configuration ==

When activated, the HttpService will run according to the JettyConfiguration properties:

[snippet,java]
----
source=libraries/http/src/main/java/org/qi4j/library/http/JettyConfiguration.java
tag=config
----

== Writing a ServletService ==

Plain old servlet are usable with the HttpService. Here is a simple example from the tests:

[snippet,java]
----
source=libraries/http/src/test/java/org/qi4j/library/http/HelloWorldServlet.java
tag=servlet
----

Servlets in HttpService are Services, so you have to declare a ServiceComposite like this one:

[snippet,java]
----
source=libraries/http/src/test/java/org/qi4j/library/http/HelloWorldServletService.java
tag=servletservice
----

== Writing a FilterService ==

It's the same for Filters. As an example here is the bundled UnitOfWorkFilterService declaration:

[snippet,java]
----
source=libraries/http/src/main/java/org/qi4j/library/http/UnitOfWorkFilterService.java
tag=filterservice
----

== Assembly ==

The HTTP library provide a JettyServiceAssembler and a fluent API to easily assemble Servlets and Filters:

[snippet,java]
----
source=libraries/http/src/test/java/org/qi4j/library/http/JettyServiceTest.java
tag=assembly
----
